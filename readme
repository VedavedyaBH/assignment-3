How it works?.

*This code is written in c++.
*(Due to some problems) Give the inputs inside the code itself
*Since the code cannot take inputs from the file, we need to manually give the inputs inside the
code.
*Give the size i.e V and E.
*Then give the edges manually after the space provided in the main function.(after the equals
symbol)
Ex:
int V =3 ;
int E =4 ;
struct Gp* graph = CG(V, E);
graph->edge[0].src =1 ;
graph->edge[0].dest =2 ;
graph->edge[0].weight = 3;
*Complie the program.
*Run the program


Challenges Faced
